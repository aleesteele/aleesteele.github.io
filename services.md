In 2025, I founded <a href="https://www.studio-sanshin.com">Studio Sanshin</a> as the home for my freelancing and creative practice – a space I'm cultivating where research, design, and storytelling meet.  

I offer services in research, creative communication, community-centered practices, accessibility, conflict-meditation, human-centered design, and facilitation, drawing on almost a decade experience working at the intersection of creative communication, community-led collaboration, and open practices.  

My work often bridges disciplines – combining the rigor of social science with the sensitivity of artistic practice – to help organizations and teams think deeply, design thoughtfully, and act collectively. 

Whether through participatory research, inclusive workshop design, or creative strategy, I aim to create spaces where people and ideas can connect meaningfully. 

If you’re looking for support on a project, collaboration, or workshop, please <a href="mailto:anne@studio-sanshin.com">contact me</a> for rates and availability.
