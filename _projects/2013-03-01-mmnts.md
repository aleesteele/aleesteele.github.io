*Mmnts*, a play on the word "moments" was a small platform for submitting stories (what I called "mmnts").

I received permission from the artist Daehyun Kim (<a href="http://www.moonassi.com">also known as moonassi</a>) to develop stickers that were posted around the city of Wellington, NZ, where I was based at the time.
