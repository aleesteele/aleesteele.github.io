As I grew more exposed to the world of open knowledge and the <a href="https://ia800101.us.archive.org/1/items/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008.pdf">politics of open access</a>, I wanted to see if I could build bridges between this type of approach and my own background in Anthropology and Sociology.

In disciplinary environments, I often found that social scientists tended to think of open source as a computer science issue, not a broader question of knowledge access, or even creative ways of distributing knowledge. One example of this was my work as a Frictionless Data fellow at OKF, where I was the only social scientist in the room. Conversely, when surrounded by social scientists, technologies tended to be taboo to discuss or even employed (or conversely, fetishized).

I thrive in this kind of interdisciplinarity, but I thought there might need to be a middle ground.

In reaction to this, I created "open source social science", an open source collection of tools that both qualitative and quantitative social scientists can do to make their work more open, accessible, and usable.
