When I became an Artistic Research Fellow at the School of Commons at the Zurich School of the Arts, we have been investigating the meeting point between the abstraction of poetry, the process of datafication, and extractive processes through audio recordings and sensory practices more specifically. 


The project ‘aims to bring together a body of work that aims to answer the question: how do we counter the embodied ethos of extraction? how can we gather existing techniques – and develop new ways of engaging with our bodies to combat extraction’s effects? how can the metaphor of poetry can be used to combat the abstraction of datafication? when physical extraction is constitutive of digital culture, as well as a pervasive ethos and social norm, what role can poetry (and poetic tactics) play?
