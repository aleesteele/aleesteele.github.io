**Digital cairns** is an ongoing series of walking tours, currently based in London.

Drawing inspiration from cairns and shrines to explore digital formats for wayfaring, marking, guiding and tracing forest relations on the web.

The systemic solutions for upscaling of urgent ecosystem restoration for forest-related biodiversity and ecosystem services, also known as SUPERB, project is led by the European Forest Institute and involves a consortium of 36 project partners and 90 associate partners, and receives €20 million in support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme.

King’s contribution will focus on exploring how humanities-based digital methods can be used to understand forest issues and broader societal contexts and engagements around restoration, drawing on approaches from fields such as science and technology studies, environmental humanities and Internet studies.
