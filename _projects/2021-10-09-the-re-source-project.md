over the past few months, my collaborator miriam matthiessen ([@miriammthsn](https://twitter.com/miriammthsn)) and i have been presenting our new collaboration: supply chains and us. while this is supply we'll be building up and revisiting in the coming months, i thought i would log some of our progress here.

[supply-chains.us](supply-chains.us/) was our visual attempt at a digital exhibit. it was our attempt to creatively encapsulate the overwhelming _feeling_ of being in the supply chain, not just the logistical _factual_ nature of it. here are a few screenshots:

we presented at a few conferences this spring, including MozFest, csv,CONF and RightsCon! it was super exciting to get it out into the world, and we really feel like this is only the beginning.

miriam & i recently were given the opportunity to continue our collaboration at Wikimedia Deutschland's Unlock Accelerator. It's been a great opportunity to learn about how open knowledge works in action, and the role that tech might play in these spaces. as social scientists, we found ourselves ourselves in an unfamiliar environmental: that of product development, dominated by notions of efficiency and productivity. it's been a challenging (but ultimately extremely fruitful!) time, and so i thought i'd post one of our status updates here.
