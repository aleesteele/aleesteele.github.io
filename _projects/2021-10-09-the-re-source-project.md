**The Re:source Project** was a browser extension that shares information about working conditions across suply chains.

From 2020 to 2022, I collaborated with researcher (and dear old friend!) <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/people/miriam-matthiessen">Miriam Matthissen</a> on a variety of projects related to supply chains and global logistics. This was one of those projects.

During the summer of 2021, we were given the opportunity to expand our collaboration as residents at Wikimedia Deutschland's Unlock Accelerator. The program was a crash course in product development and innovation frameworks, which we wrote about on the <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/unlock-blog/supply-chains/">project blog</a>.

As researchers with a commitment to building on the existing ecosystem of tools instead of creating something new immediately, we spoke to many experts from across the supply chain as a part of user research: researchers, trade unionists, investigative reporters, artists, technologists and developers.

What we found was that there was more need for connection across the ecosystem, as well as public communication, rather than new tools. After reviewing contributions to supply chain-related topics on Wikipedia and other open platforms, we ultimately developed a browser extension that aimed to inform users about working conditions within the supply chain.

We presented the project findings at the Accelerator's Demo Day:
