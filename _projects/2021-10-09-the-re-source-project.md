**The Re:source Project** was a browser extension and research project about supply chains.


From 2020 to 2022, I collaborated with researcher (and dear old friend!) <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/people/miriam-matthiessen">Miriam Matthissen</a> on a variety of projects related to supply chains. 

We reconnected in 2020 over a shared interest in supply chains and international logistics networks, which we witnessed breaking down in real time during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. After I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/criticaltheoryiheid/photos/the-critical-theory-reading-group-will-be-meeting-virtually-for-its-fourth-sprin/227376385371260/?_rdr">Critical Theory Reading Group</a>, we started havine bi-weekly calls that eventually expanded into a larger Supply Chains Reading Group after we organised a session at the Mozilla Festival in 2021.

As an expression of our converging (and diverging) interests, Miriam and I developed **supply-chains.us**, an attempt to creatively encapsulate the overwhelming _feeling_ of being in the supply chain, not just the logistical _factual_ nature of it. As a part of this process, we made a "scrollytelling" essay about supply chains alongside collages that combined open access imagery and soundscapes from various steps of the supply chain.

Increasingly, we found that Miriam was particularly interested in shipping networks, and myself in extractive industries like mining.

We collectively called this the "re:source project"

miriam & i recently were given the opportunity to continue our collaboration at Wikimedia Deutschland's Unlock Accelerator. It's been a great opportunity to learn about how open knowledge works in action, and the role that tech might play in these spaces. as social scientists, we found ourselves ourselves in an unfamiliar environmental: that of product development, dominated by notions of efficiency and productivity. it's been a challenging (but ultimately extremely fruitful!) time, and so i thought i'd post one of our status updates here.
