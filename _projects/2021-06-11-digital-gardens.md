I maintained a **digital garden** between 2021 and 2022 as a part of my MA research.

Inspired by <a href="https://indieweb.org">"indie web"</a> thought leaders like <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton</a>, <a href="https://nadia.xyz">Nadia Asparaouhouva (then Eghbal)</a>, and <a href="https://sariazout.substack.com/p/check-your-pulse-55">Sara Azout</a> - I grew increasingly more inspired by the notion of thinking out loud and in public.

This digital garden was a place to do that, and more visually demonstrate the connections between the different bodies of work I was citing.
