In Geneva, I worked on a variety of different projects at different international organisations throughout my MA studies.

Being an anthropologist / sociologist in Geneva means that the United Nations and similar organisations could be places for 'fieldwork', and I took full advantage of that: diving into the archives of the International Labour Organisation, visiting lectures at the libraries of the United Nations, recording the infamous <a href="https://www.ungeneva.org/en/meetings-events/rooms/room-xx">Room XX (20) at the United Nations</a>, and interviewing the UNHCR Innovation team about their practices for supporting refugee populations.

At the Graduate Institute, I started becoming increasingly interested in anthropological studies of bureaucracy (even the ritual of paperwork!) and the notion of 'studying up' with systems of power rather than simply apply the ethnographic lens to societies far flung from where I lived (and often in asymmetrical power dyamics with the researcher).

Unlike the HRC, which evaluates countries collectively, the UPR allows countries to communicate more directly and in a public forum. Evaluated according to the language and laws that were codified in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the UPR is the only mechanism of its kind.

In response to this, I approached the team at the UPR Review with my findings, with the aim of
