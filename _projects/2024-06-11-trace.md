**"Trace"** is an interactive installation about technology supply chains.

This installation explores the complexity of global supply chains through two types of maps: physical and auditory. A tactile, auditory experience used a standing globe with electric paint to trigger sounds from different supply chain steps, such as mining, manufacturing, shipping, waste, and recycling, when touched.

where participants were able to touch a physical globe, triggering sounds from across the routes of technology supply chains.
