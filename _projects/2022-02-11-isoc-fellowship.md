**Above the clouds and below the sea** is a visual research project about internet infrastructure.

I was an <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Early Career Fellow</a> with the Internet So. The programme involved modules from the Oxford Internet Institute, as well as guest lectures from across the Internet Society ecosystem.

After years of studying the open source ecosystem as a research, I was increasingly interested in the hardware behind connectivity itself. While a lot of research and writing had already been conducted on internet cables, low earth orbits satellites were an emerging area (especially the growth of companies like Starlink).

The culmination of my work was an interactive website that shares multimedia and other information about physical infrastructures required for internet connectivity.
