**Poetic tactics to counter extraction (and other tools to train attention)** is a long-term research project.

Poetic tactics investigated the meeting point between the abstraction of poetry, the process of datafication, and extractive processes through audio recordings and sensory practices more specifically.

The project aimed to to bring together a body of work that aims to answer the following questions:
- How do we counter the embodied ethos of extraction?
- How can we gather existing techniques – and develop new ways of engaging with our bodies to combat extraction’s effects?
- How can the metaphor of poetry can be used to combat the abstraction of datafication?
- When physical extraction is constitutive of digital culture, as well as a pervasive ethos and social norm, what role can poetry (and poetic tactics) play?

Over the course of two years, I investigated this theme in a number of different modes.

So far, there have been a number of different outputs: 
- Workshops on somatic mapping and poetic meditations (including ['mapping meditations'](https://hackmd.io/@aleesteele/soc-mapping-meditations) and deep listening exercises)
- Multimedia installations (including [trace]() and [elegies]())
- Poetry series
- Microsite

In many ways, this project continues on, but in different forms and as discrete projects.
