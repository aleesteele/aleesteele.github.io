From 2022, I developed a number of projects on **community data stewardship** as alternatives to mainstream AI alongside researcher <a href="https://jending.com">Jennifer Ding</a>.

As the community manager of _The Turing Way_, it became increasingly clear that grassroots data practitioners were feeding into much bigger systems, least of all huge projects like OpenAI's Chat GPT. 

In discussions with Jennifer, we started drafting what felt like a . She was collaborating with people building alternative LLMs at places like HuggingFace, CohereAI and others.

As a part of this work we also presented this work in a few different locations, including: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3gI_BUgF94">"Designing for Data Rights in the AI Production Pipeline"</a> session at the Mozilla Festival in 2023 and <a href="https://vimeo.com/896337724">"Participatory data stewardship in AI"</a> at Mozilla's Data Futures Lab's Community Call.
