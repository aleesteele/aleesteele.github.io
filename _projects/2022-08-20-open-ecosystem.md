**Mapping the open ecosystem** was a research project to understand how different actors spoke about and engaged with the topic of openness.

After working with groups in the open ecosystem like the Open Knowledge Foundation, the Internet Society, and others – I quickly realised that the open scientists I was interacting with at _The Turing Way_ think about openness in a very different way.

Mapping the open ecosystem became a continous exercise throughout 2022 and 2023, in order to understand the contours of this ecosystem.

If you're interested in translated this map into other mediums and forms, please contact me! I'd love to make this project more sustainable and interoperable - with the possibility of crowdsourcing contributions.
