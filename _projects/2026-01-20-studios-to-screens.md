**From Studios to Screens: connecting creative computation to academic computing** is a 2026 research fellowship project supported by the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>.

The project connects computational and AI artists with research software engineering (RSE) practices, while bringing creative, critical, and poetic approaches into academic computing. It explores what these overlapping communities can learn from one another — and how imagination and infrastructure might work together more intentionally.

Outcomes may include interviews, collaborations, gatherings, or a publication.
