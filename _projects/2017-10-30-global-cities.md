**We have always been global** was an interactive database of the word's global cities. 

I built this as my final project at an intensive <a href="https://www.spiced-academy.com/en">Javascript-focused web development course</a>. 

Using the Google Chrome Experiment as a template, I combined my love of open data with a 3D rendering of the planet in order to create an interactive visualization (my first ever at the time!).

When the page loads, users are told to write a city of choice, marked by a red point on the globe:

Once given a city, the page loads information onto the page, including population data, sunrise/sunset times, and recent news/social media updates scraped from local new platforms and other sources.
