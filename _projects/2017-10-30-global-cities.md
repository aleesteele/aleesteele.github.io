**Global Cities** was an interactive database of the word's global cities. 

I built this as my final project at Spiced Academy, during the last week of the Javascript-focused web development course. Check out a live demo [here](https://global-cities.herokuapp.com/) and the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

When the page loads, users are told to write a city of choice, the press enter.

Once given a city, the page loads information onto the page, including population data, sunrise/sunset/etc times, and recent news/social media updates.
