**We have always been global** was an interactive database of the word's global cities. 

I built this as my final project at an intensive <a href="https://www.spiced-academy.com/en">Javascript-focused web development course</a>. 

Using the Google Chrome Experiment as a template, I combined my groint love of open data with a 3D rendering of the planet in order to create an interactive visualization (my first ever!). I was learning web development at a time when we thought <a href="https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/the-history-of-data-journalism">data was going to change how we told stories</a>, and thereby the peoples and societies those stories were about. 

In many ways, the open data movement (which began in the late ~2000s) preceded the early days of data journalism, as countless government datasets were put online for journalists to analyse for the first time.

When I made this project, I was definitely aware of the scales that big data enabled, and I was really interested in rendering that complexity in more interesting ways. A few years previous, I had worked for a sociologist named Saskia Sassen at Columbia, who's work had focused on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc93q"Global Cities</a>, and increasingly, the extractions and expulsions that take place in their wake.

In this interactive project, users are told to write a city of choice, marked by a red point on the globe:

Once given a city, the page loads information onto the page, including population data, sunrise/sunset times, and recent news/social media updates scraped from local new platforms and other sources.

This project was the first project that  my growing interest in data visualisation and data journalism with
