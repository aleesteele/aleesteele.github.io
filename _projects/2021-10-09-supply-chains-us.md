**Supply chains and us** was a multi-media website about 

From 2020 to 2022, I collaborated with researcher (and dear old friend!) <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/people/miriam-matthiessen">Miriam Matthissen</a> on a variety of projects related to supply chains. 

We reconnected in 2020 over a shared interest in supply chains and international logistics networks, which we witnessed breaking down in real time during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. After I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/criticaltheoryiheid/photos/the-critical-theory-reading-group-will-be-meeting-virtually-for-its-fourth-sprin/227376385371260/?_rdr">Critical Theory Reading Group</a>, we started havine bi-weekly calls that eventually expanded into a larger Supply Chains Reading Group after we organised a session at the Mozilla Festival in 2021.

As an expression of our converging (and diverging) interests, Miriam and I developed **supply-chains.us**, an attempt to creatively encapsulate the overwhelming _feeling_ of being in the supply chain, not just the logistical _factual_ nature of it. As a part of this process, we made a "scrollytelling" essay about supply chains alongside collages that combined open access imagery and soundscapes from various steps of the supply chain.

While this work is no longer online, here are a few screenshots:

The essay enclosed in the piece is below:

> 50 mineral elements are used in 98% of all electronic devices, from consumer cell phones to computers, from solar panels to electric cars.

> As we head towards an ever more digital future, we are becoming increasingly dependent on extractive and global processes to support it.

> For many of us, the electronic supply chain is characterised by its seamlessness and abstraction. Think: ‘one-click ordering’ or ‘next day delivery’.

> Yet, these processes invariably depend on labour that is often tedious and slow, and carried out under precarious and hazardous conditions.

> While many journalists have reported on supply chain working conditions, they sometimes end up reproducing the dominant narratives surrounding these processes.

> Such narratives center the consumer of a marketed end product, forgetting that the electronic supply chain doesn’t stop with the consumer at all...

> ...but continues on into recycling centers, with salvagers, and at e-waste sites around the world...

> ...Reminding us that words like ‘end consumer’ and ‘end product’ are situated, and offer only a partial perspective of consumer technology life cycles.

> They beg the questions: end consumer of what and end product for whom?

> supply-chains.us is a living archive that traces these uneven geographies, extractive processes, and forgotten labour involved in the production of our digital life.




We ended up giving a few collaboratively-made talks on the subject and project:

As this work continued to develop, 


We ended up giving a lecture at the New Schools "Internet Geographies" course

We also were selected for Transmediale's workshop "
