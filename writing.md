I recently started newsletter titled **"Field notes from the Internet""**.

After an internet infrastructure  so that they could respond by email or add comments. I'm not sure how I'll manage these subscriptions yet, but I'll make sure you get alerted:

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/aleesteele"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/aleesteele', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
  style="border:1px; background-color:#ffffff;"
>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" style="border:1px; background-color:#ffffff;" placeholder="add your email here" /> 
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" style="border:1px; background-color:#ffffff;" />
</form><br/>

Below is my blog, which is full of more less curated reflections.

Over the past few years, I've slowly aimed to return to blogging, and more carefully tend to this space. I haven't really had a regular blog in years, choosing instead to write long emails to friends, family, and other loved ones. These days, I don't write as many long emails, but I still believe that a regular writing & reflection practice is important, perhaps as opposed to (or perhaps just in parallel) to the kind of stream-of-consciousness you get on social media.

As a part of this, I 2021 to 2022, I maintained a <a href="https://notes.aleesteele.com/">digital garden</a> (kept alive for archival purposes), which primarily tied to my MA. I've since transitioned most of my sporatic note-taking and sparks of inspiration to [are.na](https://www.are.na/anne-lee-steele) and <a href="http://instagram.com/anneleesteele">instagram</a>. As I wrote [here](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1687410000329678851) and [here](https://post.lurk.org/@aleesteele/110830839366429110), I tend to use social spaces for thinking out loud and all sorts of digital "gathering".

So in short, in order of most to least curated:
- Newsletter: Upcoming events, workshops, infrastructure walks, tactics from the poetic web
- Blog: Unofficial reflections, both personal and professional
- Are.na: Uncurated brain dump, link-saving

Enjoy! if you have any questions, suggestions, or reflections of your own, please feel free to [contact me]().
