I recently started a newsletter called **"Field Notes from the Internet"** – a more structured space for sharing upcoming events, workshops, interviews, and news from the poetic web.

In many ways, it gathers the best and most relevant parts of my blog and other platforms. I'm still getting the hang of the right rhythm and frequency, but aim for once a quarter.

For years, I wrote long emails to friends and family — and while I don’t do that much anymore, I still believe in the value of a public writing and reflection practice, as a slower alternative (or companion) to the stream-of-consciousness of social media.

From 2021 to 2022, I maintained a <a href="https://notes.aleesteele.com/">digital garden</a> (now archived), alongside my MA research. These days, most of my notes and inspiration live on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/anne-lee-steele) and <a href="http://instagram.com/anneleesteele">Instagram</a>. As I've written [here](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1687410000329678851) and [here](https://post.lurk.org/@aleesteele/110830839366429110), I use social spaces as places for for thinking out loud and gathering ideas in public.

Hope you enjoy exploring! If something resonates, feel free to share reflections or thoughts of your own.
