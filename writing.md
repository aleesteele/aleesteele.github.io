I recently started a newsletter called **"Field Notes from the Internet""**.

This is a much more structured newsletter that has information about upcoming events, workshops, and other news from the poetic web that I'd like to share. It takes the best and most relevant parts of my blog, and packages them up.

You're welcome to subscribe here:

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/aleesteele"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/aleesteele', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
  style="border:1px; background-color:#61cffc; max-width: 300px;"

  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" style="border:1px; background-color:#ffffff;" placeholder="add your email here" />

Below is my blog archive.

For years, I wrote long emails to friends, family, and other loved ones. These days, I don't write as many long emails, but I still believe that a regular writing & reflection practice is important, perhaps as opposed to (or perhaps just in parallel) to the kind of stream-of-consciousness you get on social media.

As a part of this, I 2021 to 2022, I maintained a <a href="https://notes.aleesteele.com/">digital garden</a> (kept alive for archival purposes), which was primarily tied to my MA. I've since transitioned most of my sporatic note-taking and sparks of inspiration to [are.na](https://www.are.na/anne-lee-steele) and <a href="http://instagram.com/anneleesteele">instagram</a>. As I wrote [here](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1687410000329678851) and [here](https://post.lurk.org/@aleesteele/110830839366429110), I tend to use social spaces for thinking out loud and all sorts of digital "gathering".

So in short, in order of most to least curated:
- Newsletter: Upcoming events, workshops, infrastructure walks, tactics from the poetic web
- Blog: Unofficial reflections, both personal and professional
- Are.na: Uncurated brain dump, link-saving

Enjoy! if you have any questions, suggestions, or reflections of your own, please feel free to [contact me]().
