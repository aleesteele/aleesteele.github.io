**While I'm most often defined as a writer, my creative practice is increasingly medium-agnostic.** Each project takes the form it needs - whether writing, sound, images, code or something else. Despite this, mapping is one form that I seem to return to again and again.

Across these shifting forms, my themes have remained consistent: **I explore the tensions between the global and the local, the medium and the message, and the infrastructures (material, cultural, technological, and ecological) that shape our everyday lives.** Once upon a time, I would have said that I'm somewhere at the intersection of art and technology (<a href="https://x.com/FeltZine/status/1371793374500376578">now rightfully meme-ified</a>).

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I am circulating around the same ideas in different ways - almost like a circumambulation around a stupa. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every rotation, I get closer to the truth, or at least a truth"._ The image stayed with me. She reminded me of the rituals of pilgrimage, and I'm ever-curious as to how themes recur, return and reshape themselves throughout our lives. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included a number of older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects came to full fruition, but each one contained the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. 

It is in that accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
