## For my professional experience, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKDlEjZSoO62cHdX4JRUoTx8gaxntpWu/view?usp=share_link">download my CV</a>.

**I'm trained as an anthropologist, not an artist.** This means that I believe in a strong _conceptual_ basis for any project, wherein the medium tends to follow in order to transform it into something tangible: a piece of writing, a map, a media installation, or something else.

Even as the forms evolve, my themes have remained consistent: **I explore the tensions between global processes and local politics, the digital mediums and the message they convey, and the infrastructures (material, cultural, technological, and ecological) that shape our lives.** Once upon a time, I would have said that I'm somewhere at the intersection of art and technology (<a href="https://x.com/FeltZine/status/1371793374500376578">now rightfully meme-ified</a>).

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I'm circulating around the same ideas in different ways. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every rotation, I get closer to the truth, or at least a truth"._ The image stayed with me. Like the the rituals of pilgrimage, I'm always curious as to how themes recur, return and reshape themselves throughout our lives. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included a number of older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects came to full fruition, but each one contained the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. 

It is in that accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
