👉 **My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneleesteele/">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKDlEjZSoO62cHdX4JRUoTx8gaxntpWu/view?usp=share_link">CV</a> are the homes of my professional work.** 

**For the projects listed below, it's important to note that I'm trained as an anthropologist, not an artist.** This means that I believe in a strong _conceptual_ basis for any project, wherein the medium follows to transform it into something tangible: a piece of writing or a map, a media installation, or something else entirely (like a walking tour!).

Even as the forms evolve, my themes have remained consistent: **I keep returning to the tensions between global systems and local realities, or the ways media and technology shape meaning and belonging. I'm ever-curious about the infrastructures (material, cultural, technological, ecological) that organise our everyday lives.** Once upon a time, I would have said that I'm somewhere at the intersection of art and technology (<a href="https://x.com/FeltZine/status/1371793374500376578">now rightfully meme-ified</a>).

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I'm circulating around the same ideas in different ways. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every rotation, I get closer to the truth, or at least a truth"._ The image stayed with me. Like the the rituals of pilgrimage, I'm always curious as to how themes recur, return and reshape themselves throughout our lives. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included a number of older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects came to full fruition, but each one contained the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. 

It is in this accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
