**While I'm most often defined as a writer, my practice is ultimately medium-agnostic.** Each project takes the form it needs - whether writing, sound, images, painting, code or something else — depending on what the inquiry demands. Mapping is one form that I return to again and again.

Across these shifting forms, my themes have remained consistent: I explore the tensions between the global and the local, the medium and the message, and the infrastructures (material, cultural, technological, and ecological) that shape our everyday lives. In more ways then one, I find myself caught between screens and summits.

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I am circulating around the same ideas, versions of myself, and guiding principles - almost like a circumambulation around a stupa. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every roation, you get closer to the truth"._ The image stayed with me. It reminded me of the rituals of pilgrimage, and I've become ever-curious as to how themes recur, return and reshape themselves over time. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects come to full fruition, but each one contains the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. It is in that accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
