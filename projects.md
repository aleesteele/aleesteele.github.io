👉 **My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneleesteele/">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKDlEjZSoO62cHdX4JRUoTx8gaxntpWu/view?usp=share_link">CV</a> are the homes of my professional work.** 

For the projects listed below, please note that I'm trained as an anthropologist, not an artist. 

This means that I believe in a strong _conceptual_ basis for any project, wherein the medium follows to transform it into something tangible: a piece of writing or a map, a media installation, or something else entirely (like a walking tour!). Once upon a time, I would have said that I'm somewhere at the intersection of art and technology (<a href="https://x.com/FeltZine/status/1371793374500376578">now rightfully meme-ified</a>).

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I'm circulating around the same ideas in different ways. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every rotation, I get closer to the truth, or at least a truth"._ The image stayed with me. Like the the rituals of pilgrimage, I'm believe that themes recur, return and reshape themselves throughout our lives. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included a number of older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects came to full fruition, but each one contained the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. 

It is in this accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
