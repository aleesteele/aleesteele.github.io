## For my professional experience, you can download my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKDlEjZSoO62cHdX4JRUoTx8gaxntpWu/view?usp=share_link">here</a>.

**First and foremost, I'd probably say that I'm a writer. Despite this, my work seems to say something else: that I'm medium-agnostic and  multimedia artist.** Each project seems to take the form it needs - whether writing, sound, images, code or something else. Despite this, mapping is one form that I seem to return to again and again.

I'm not trained as an artist, but rather an anthropologist. This means that I believe in strong _conceptual_ bases for any project. THe medium follows the concept, turning it into something else.

Across these shifting forms, my themes have remained consistent: **I explore the invisible between the global processes and the local politics, the digital mediums and the message they convey, and the infrastructures (material, cultural, technological, and ecological) that shape our everyday lives.** Once upon a time, I would have said that I'm somewhere at the intersection of art and technology (<a href="https://x.com/FeltZine/status/1371793374500376578">now rightfully meme-ified</a>).

Recently, I told a mentor that I often feel like I am circulating around the same ideas in different ways - almost like a circumambulation around a stupa. _“There are stupas in the mind!” she said in response, "I find that with every rotation, I get closer to the truth, or at least a truth"._ The image stayed with me. She reminded me of the rituals of pilgrimage, and I'm ever-curious as to how themes recur, return and reshape themselves throughout our lives. 

With this in mind, I’ve also included a number of older projects below to draw a through-line across my work. Not all projects came to full fruition, but each one contained the seeds of the next: ideas that weren’t ready yet, or skills I was still developing. Either way, I learned from the process. 

It is in that accumulation of attempts, experiments, failures, and returns that you can trace the evolution of my practice - and by extension, myself.
