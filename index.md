I'm a researcher, facilitator, and artist based in the United Kingdom. 

Most of what I do aims to understand and support the people &amp; processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructure, extractive industries, and supply chains) as well as the political processes they feed into. I approach most situations as an ethnographer first, and as a community-builder second.

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN, the home of my creative studio practice. You can <a href="http://aleesteele.com/services">check out the services I offer on this page</a>.

Previously, I was the Community Manager for <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html">The Turing Way</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>, where I stewarded an open source, community-driven resource for reproducible data science. During this time, I was Fellow at the <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, an artistic research programme based at the Zurich School of the Arts and an <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Early Career Fellow at the Internet Society</a>.

Previously, I was a mentor for <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Life Science</a>, cohort #5. I was also an <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/february-2022/">Early Career Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/">Internet Society</a>, where I investigated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite supply chains, and was a co-curator of <a href="https://resource-project.co/">The Re:source Project</a>, which was incubated at Wikimedia Deutchland's <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Unlock Accelerator</a>.

I completed my MA at the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies</a> in Geneva, where I learned about open geospatial data and humanitarian mapping practices on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> with the <a href="https://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. From 2020-2021, I was a <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="frictionless.png">Reproducible Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. I was associated with the <a href="https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/ccdp">Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding</a>, more specifically with the <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a>.

Before moving to Switzerland, I researched conservation in Bhutan, co-led student expeditions in Nepal for National Geographic, and coded data visualizations for the Dracopolous iDeas Lab at CSIS. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict. I also designed media for different organizations in New York City, and organized a technology-arts festival in New Zealand. 

While I grew up in the shadow of the oil industry in Texas, I was born in Chicago, and mostly raised in a big blue van – and on big bowls of miyeok-guk (미역국). When I'm not on a computer, I'm usually outside.
