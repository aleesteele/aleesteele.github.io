I'm a researcher, facilitator, and artist based in the UK.

My work explores the invisible people and processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructures, extractive industries, and supply chains) as well as the political systems they sustain. I approach most things as an ethnographer first and a community-builder second. Lately, I’ve turned to media art to translate this complexity into .

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN.

Previously, I was Community Manager for _The Turing Way_ at the Alan Turing Institute, a Fellow at the School of Commons, and an Early Career Fellow at the Internet Society. I’ve also mentored with Open Life Science and co-curated The Re:source Project through Wikimedia Deutschland’s Unlock Accelerator.

I hold an MA from the Graduate Institute, Geneva, where I researched open geospatial data and humanitarian mapping with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and made data visualisations for the Transparency Lab. Before that, I researched conservation politics in Bhutan, led student expeditions in Nepal for National Geographic, and designed multimedia for the Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS.

Born in Chicago and raised between Texas and a big blue van, I grew up on bowls of miyeok-guk (미역국). When I’m not online, I’m usually outside.

I'm a researcher, facilitator, and artist based in the United Kingdom. 

Most of what I do aims to understand and support the people &amp; processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructure, extractive industries, and supply chains) as well as the political processes they feed into. I approach most situations as an ethnographer first, and as a community-builder second. Most recently, I've turned to media art.

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN. You can <a href="http://aleesteele.com/services">check out the services I offer on this page</a>.

Most recently, I was the Community Manager for <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html">The Turing Way</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>. During this time, I was Fellow at the <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, an artistic research programme based at the Zurich School of the Arts and an <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Early Career Fellow at the Internet Society</a>.

Previously, I was a mentor for <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Life Science</a>, cohort #5. I was also an <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/february-2022/">Early Career Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/">Internet Society</a>, where I investigated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite supply chains, and was a co-curator of <a href="https://resource-project.co/">The Re:source Project</a>, which was incubated at Wikimedia Deutchland's <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Unlock Accelerator</a>.

I completed my MA at the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies</a> in Geneva, where I learned about open geospatial data and humanitarian mapping practices on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> with the <a href="https://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. From 2020-2021, I was a <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="frictionless.png">Reproducible Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. I was associated with the <a href="https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/ccdp">Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding</a>, more specifically with the <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a>.

Before moving to Switzerland, I researched conservation in Bhutan, co-led student expeditions in Nepal for National Geographic, and coded data visualizations for the Dracopolous iDeas Lab at CSIS. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict. I also designed media for different organizations in New York City, and organized a technology-arts festival in New Zealand. 

While I grew up in the shadow of the oil industry in Texas, I was born in Chicago, and mostly raised in a big blue van – and on big bowls of miyeok-guk (미역국). When I'm not on a computer, I'm usually outside.
