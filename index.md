_👋 **Thank you for visiting my website. I appreciate you being here.**_

My work centers on the invisible people and processes behind our digital lives. Sometimes that means building and supporting projects grounded in care, maintenance, and attention. Other times, it means tracing the infrastructures, industries, and supply chains that make our technologies possible.

I approach most things as an ethnographer first and a community-builder second. In recent years, I’ve turned to media art to reimagine new forms of public engagement, though I remain a writer at heart.

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN as the home for my work in public interest technology, culture and research, which you can [explore here](https://www.aleesteele.com/services).

Over a little less than a decade, I’ve contributed to a variety of initiatives spanning open infrastructures, responsible technology, and cultural engagement – through roles, fellowships, collaborations, and more at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk">British Red Cross</a>, <a href="https://www.csis.org/dracopoulos-ideas-lab">Dracopoulos iDeas Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Internet Society</a>, <a href="https://www.missingmaps.org">Missing Maps</a>, <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Seeds</a>, <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a>, <a href="https://transmediale.de/en">Transmediale</a>, <a href="https://book.the-turing-way.org">The Turing Way</a>, and <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Wikimedia Deutschland’s Unlock Accelerator</a>. My previous research on digital humanitarism on OpenStreetMap can be found <a href="">here</a>. I remain an organiser of the <a href="https://research-fosdem.github.io">FOSDEM Open Research Devroom</a>, the largest open source conference in Europe.

I hold an MA from the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute, Geneva</a> and a BA from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>. When I’m not online, I’m usually outside.
