My work focuses on the invisible people and processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructures, extractive industries, and supply chains). 

I approach most things as an ethnographer first and a community-builder second. In recent years, I’ve turned to media art to reimagine new forms of public engagement. I remain a writer at heart.

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN as the home for my work in public interest technology, culture and research, which you can [explore here](https://www.aleesteele.com/services). 

Over the past decade, I’ve contributed to initiatives spanning open infrastructures, responsible technology, and cultural engagement – through roles, fellowships, mentorships, collaborations, and residencies at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>, <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Internet Society</a>, <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, Wikimedia Deutschland’s <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Unlock Accelerator</a>, <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Seeds</a>, <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://www.csis.org/dracopoulos-ideas-lab">Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS</a>. I remain an organiser of the <a href="https://research-fosdem.github.io">FOSDEM Open Research Devroom</a>, the largest open source conference in Europe.

I hold an MA from the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute, Geneva</a> and a BA from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>, both in anthropology and sociology. When I’m not online, I’m usually outside.
