My work focuses on the invisible people and processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructures, extractive industries, and supply chains). I approach most things as an ethnographer first and a community-builder second, though in recent years I’ve turned to media art to reimagine new forms of public engagement. 

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN as the home for my work in public interest technology, culture and research, which you can [explore here](https://www.aleesteele.com/services). 

Over the past decade, I've held a variety of different roles and fellowships to this effect: at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>, <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Internet Society</a>, <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, Wikimedia Deutschland’s <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Unlock Accelerator</a>, <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.csis.org/dracopoulos-ideas-lab">Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS</a>.

I hold an MA from the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute, Geneva</a> and a BA from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>, both in anthropology and sociology. Born in Chicago and raised across five states, I grew up on bowls of miyeok-guk (미역국) and lots of movement. When I’m not online, I’m usually outside.
