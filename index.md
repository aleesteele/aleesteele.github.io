I'm a researcher, facilitator, and artist based in the UK.

My work explores the invisible people and processes behind our digital lives (think: open source infrastructures, extractive industries, and supply chains), and the political systems they sustain. I approach most things as an ethnographer first and a community-builder second, though in recent years I’ve turned to media art to reimagine new forms of public engagement. 

In 2025, I founded STUDIO SANSHIN as the home for my work in public interest technology, culture and research, which you can [explore here](https://www.aleesteele.com/services).

Previously, I was Community Manager for <a href="https://the-turing-way.org">_The Turing Way_</a> at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>. I have held fellowships with the <a href="https://schoolofcommons.org">School of Commons</a>, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2022/">Internet Society</a>, and <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. I’ve also mentored with <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Seeds</a> and co-curated The Re:source Project through Wikimedia Deutschland’s <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/unlock/">Unlock Accelerator</a>. I remain an organiser of the <a href="https://research-fosdem.github.io">FOSDEM Open Research Devroom</a>, the largest open source conference in Europe.

I hold an MA from the <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/">Graduate Institute, Geneva</a> and a BA from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>. At the former, my research focused on humanitarian mapping on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> with the <a href="https://hotosm.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>, while I made data visualisations for the <a href="http://transparencylab.org/">Transparency Lab</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/ccdp">Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding</a>. Before that, I researched conservation politics in Bhutan as an undergraduate, led student expeditions in Nepal for National Geographic, and designed multimedia for the <a href="https://www.csis.org/dracopoulos-ideas-lab">Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS</a>.

Born in Chicago and raised across five states, I grew up on bowls of miyeok-guk (미역국) and lots of movement. When I’m not online, I’m usually outside.
