_18.03.2024:  A few weeks ago, I recently wrote this summary about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups for their notes. In the time since, I've decided to expand it into a broader blog, as it helps to summarise the different stages of governance that we've gone through in The Turing Way community._ 

# On Governance with The Turing Way (or how I stopped worrying and learned how to love the process) - Part 1

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or formalisation more broadly) and they'll all say the same thing: **governance is *hard***!  

As an anthropologist, I tend to think about governance in two streams, as both formal structures and informal norms:

1. **Rules, structures, and institutions** (formal): This could be considered structures that enable decision making, for organising into groups, line management, and roles that formally place people into organisational structures that govern their behavior and work in a project or community.
2. **Norms, culture, and rituals** (informal): This one is harder to pin down, because it could be *anything* that governs a persons behaviour that isn't codified. This could be as individualised as power dynamics and personalities, or as wide as cultural norms within a group, events, and more. Informal governance could be uncodified, unspoken, vague, and social norms, as opposed to codified ones. 
<br/><br/>
Within *The Turing Way*, governance (as I define and divide it into the two categories above) takes on both these forms. Early on in my time with The Turing Way, I was introduced to the [tyranny of structurelessness](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1544277587421237249), and learned just how important formalisation was for the health of a growing community or organisation more broadly. When I joined The Turing Way in March 2022, it was a project with strong norms and culture, though not necessary many formal rules or organisational structures, due to how rapidly it had grown in previous years (that had overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic).

A few notes about this writing process as well:
- This part focuses primarily on summation. In fact, I'd even say that it plays the role of conscious remembering – this is two years of work after all! In part two, I'm drawing from our ["pluses and deltas"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/templates/template-bookdash-feedback#ch-template-bookdash-feedback) reflection format we tend to use for Book Dash: aka positive learnings/outcomes as well as things I would change in retrospect.
- You'll notice that there's a lot of focus on working groups in this summary. That's not to say that our governance has translated exclusively into working groups, it's simply one of the most visible outcomes of our governance work within the community, along with other structures. 
- Each of these stages weren't explicitly planned, as we've very much tried to [move at the speed of trust](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk)  within the community, adjusting to needs as they emerged. 
- For those interested in starting a similar process, please keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats, giving trainings and talks, onboarding, reporting and more of the day-to-day operations of the project. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.
- I also want to stress that this effort also did not come from me alone. It has absolutely has been a team effort, and I've learned tons from my fellow colleauges and collaborators about the process!

I hope this documentation might be useful for other communities that are undergoing similar work. Please feel free to reach out if any of this resonates with you and your work!

# Phases of governance

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) in public, which you can read more about on that Github issue/discussion.

At the time, my research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... My net was also cast pretty wide and went in a couple of different directions. I read many reports about [community](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1518520218313801730), and [mapped the open ecosystem](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVONTviD8=/?share_link_id=718452293523) as I understood it. 

It also looked like interviews with 35+ folks in The Turing Way orbit, and maps of the project organisation more broadly: primarily volunteers within the community who had helped to establish the projects, as well as staff at the Alan Turing Institute who had been a part of its initial grant and incubation. During this time, my team at the Alan Turing Institute, the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme was also expanding rapidly – and many folks increasingly had contributions to *The Turing Way* project written into their job descriptions. This meant that I was learning about the history of the project, while negotiating the new and emerging structure of the community and my wider team, with questions like: what does a paid responsibility to contribute to the project look like? How do we support the emergence of new work streams alongside the existing contribution patterns and community of the project? 

Among many other learnings, this research process culminated in seeing that there were already identifiable workstreams within _The Turing Way_ that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project. 

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

After six months of research, it was time to put theory into practice. As opposed to the structure of establishing structures from the top down, governance became a process of formalising what was *already there*. The idea for working groups as an organisational format specifically came from the models set by other open source communities (and other forms of organisations) such as Kubernetes, Wikimedia Foundation, the Carpentries, and more. 

More broadly, the first Core Team Meeting (as a coalition of all of these groups) was organised in June 2022. It was organised as an assembly of people who had pursued work within the project both informally and formally in previous years, and it was decided that this group would meet every three months, and that working groups would be trialled as types of formalisation. Take a peak at [this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vn82xM_G-hG13YQWok27qJqJyRlHJUjAUtsGOya9Vwc/edit?usp=sharing) from June 2022, [this Github discussion](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2646) and this [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/ttw-working-group-trial) which illustrates some of this work.

The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent supporting the trialing of 4 working groups and one team (which has itself evolved into a working group structure). At this point, formalisation looked like setting up groups meeting for the first time and the surrounding "infrastructure" so to speak: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. 

Looking back, for some working groups we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and for others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. Because many of these working groups involved volunteers (and because of their other responsibilites and ongoing projects), this incubation process took months to develop into a consistent cadence, or even to consolidate the team itself to self-identify as a "team" in the first place. Looking back on that time, it is clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown. 

First trial (July - Sept 2022):
1. **Translation & Localisation Team** (pre-existing): The Translation and Localisation team was a community of folk that had formed organically in the previous two years, and were already in the process of creating governance structures that worked for them. Calling them a "team" (and adding them to our [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) really just lent institutional weight behind their process). I would say that we learned a lot from *them* in the process.
2. **Trainers & Mentors** (trialed starting July 2022): This group was tackled with addressing the task of welcoming new contributors, and/or addressing the . Importantly, the team categorised and reviewed the previous archive of talks given by TTW community members and leaders since [February 2019 to Sept 2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/105WCC53oAJ2XKK9qOvYjgKtJ3ty1zkBZBFb0IcjO_R8/edit#gid=0). However, because of the unclear aims of the group (as well as the extended responsibilites of the working group, many of which were already working on )
3. **Reviewers & Editors** (trialed starting July 2022): This group was tackled with addressing the problem of "tech debt", meaning the large number of issues and pull requests that the research process identified to be barriers for new community members. This group went through a [rigorous process of reviewing existing Issues and PRs](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2633), closing many where needed. The process
<br/><br/>
**Second trial (Oct 2022 - March 2023)**
Learning from the first trial, this second trial focused on documentation from the get-go, and 
4. **Infrastructure** (October 2022): This group was formed from identified volunteers who had previously contributed to infrastructure and maintenance within the project, as documented  [in this issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2690). While the need was identified in October 2022, the first meeting of the Infrastructure Working Group team was hosted in November 2023, which continue to this day.
5. **Accessibility** (November 2022): This group was formed informally in November 2022, but began formal meetings in April 2023. This group emerged from presentations given by collaborators and team members within the project at the November 2022 Book Dash, and a list of these ongoing tasks is documented in [this issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/accessibility-working-group/issues/7).

Of these working groups were trialed here, the Translation and Localisation, Infrastructure, and Accessibility Working Groups have continued to the present. The Trainers & Mentors and Reviewers & Editors groups, while they completed significant pieces of work, are no longer active. There have been lots of learnings that have come from all of these stages! 

## Phase 3: Reorganising & Expanding Staff and Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, a few changes occurred in our internal team, which had a broader effect on how the community organised:
- Our co-PI, Kirstie Whitaker (alongside Malvika Sharan) returned from maternity leave, which meant that there was a lot to catch-up on and share about the previous year, as well as adjust to 
- We also added a new member to our team, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, who joined at the Research Project Manager. 
- This meant that we started organising ourselves different as a deliver , which we soon called the "Core Staff Delivery team", and that there was catching-up and re-ordering of responsibilities needed internally.

During this time, I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a templatable way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see this pull request with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!), and we also moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way). 

This phase saw the continuation of Core Team meeting calls, which were retired in September 2023. Importantly, 



During this time, we also saw increased 

This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project.

We also started giving lots of talks with community members across the project: 

During this time, I also identified streams of work that did not fit into a set "working group" format, but . This included: Research Infrastructure Roles, Research Data Management, Environment and Sustainability, and Open and Ethnical AI. While these structures were formalised in the 



## Phase 4: Iterating, Documenting and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - Ongoing )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning the Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. This was a testing ground for another working group, this time oriented around a community event (like a planning committee!). We invited different community members and used this space to trial learnings from the first two working groups, with more support for meeting infrastructure.
