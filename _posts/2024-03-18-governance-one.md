_18.03.2024:  A few weeks ago, I recently wrote this summary about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups for their notes. In the time since, I've decided to expand it into a broader blog, as it helps to summarise the different stages of governance that we've gone through in The Turing Way community._ 

# On Governance (or how I stopped worrying and learned how to love the process) - Part 1

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or formalisation more broadly) and they'll all say the same thing: **governance is *hard***!  

As an anthropologist, I tend to think about governance in two streams, as both formal structures and informal norms:

1. **Rules, structures, and institutions** (formal): This could be considered structures that enable decision making, for organising into groups, line management, and roles that formally place people into organisational structures that govern their behavior and work in a project or community.
2. **Norms, culture, and rituals** (informal): This one is harder to pin down, because it could be *anything* that governs a persons behaviour that isn't codified. This could be as individualised as power dynamics and personalities, or as wide as cultural norms within a group, events, and more. Informal governance could be uncodified, unspoken, vague, and social norms, as opposed to codified ones. 

Within *The Turing Way*, governance (as I define and divide it into the two categories above) takes on both these forms. Early on in my time with The Turing Way, I was introduced to the [tyranny of structurelessness](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1544277587421237249), and learned just how important formalisation was for the health of a growing community or organisation more broadly. When I joined The Turing Way in March 2022, it was a project with strong norms and culture, though not necessary many formal rules or organisational structures, due to how rapidly it had grown in previous years (that had overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic).

A few notes about this writing process as well:
- This part focuses primarily on summation. In fact, I'd even say that it plays the role of conscious remembering – this is two years of work after all! In part two, I'm drawing from our ["pluses and deltas"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/templates/template-bookdash-feedback#ch-template-bookdash-feedback) reflection format we tend to use for Book Dash: aka positive learnings/outcomes as well as things I would change in retrospect.
- You'll notice that there's a lot of focus on working groups in this summary. That's not to say that our governance has translated exclusively into working groups, it's simply one of the most visible outcomes of our governance work within the community, along with other structures. 
- Each of these stages weren't explicitly planned, as we've very much tried to [move at the speed of trust](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk)  within the community, adjusting to needs as they emerged. 
- For those interested in starting a similar process, please keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats, giving trainings and talks, onboarding, reporting and more of the day-to-day operations of the project. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.
- I also want to stress that this effort also did not come from me alone. It has absolutely has been a team effort, and I've learned tons from my fellow colleauges and collaborators about the process!

I hope this documentation might be useful for other communities that are undergoing similar work. Please feel free to reach out if any of this resonates with you and your work!

# Phases of governance

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) in public, which you can read more about on that Github issue/discussion.

At the time, my research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... My net was also cast pretty wide and went in a couple of different directions. I read many reports about [community](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1518520218313801730), and [mapped the open ecosystem](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVONTviD8=/?share_link_id=718452293523) as I understood it. 

It also looked like interviews with 35+ folks in The Turing Way orbit, and maps of the project organisation more broadly. 

However, it ultimately culminating n realising that there were identifiable workstreams within _The Turing Way_ that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project (and prevent the [tyranny of structurelessness]()). These cues came from the models set by other open source communities (and other forms of organisations), such as Kubernetes, Wikimedia Foundation, Carpentries, and more. 

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

After six months of research, it was time to put theory into practice. The first Core Team Meeting was organised in XXX as an assembly. At this time, many


At this meeting, it was decided that we would meet every three months, and that

The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent supporting the trialing of 4 working groups and one team (which has itself evolved into a working group-like structure).

1. Translation & Localisation Team (pre-existing)
2. Trainers & Mentors (trialed starting July 2022)
3. Reviewers & Editors (trialed starting July 2022)
4. Infrastructure (October 2022): 
5. Accessibility (November 2022)

These working groups were trialed here. 

-   _**Where is friction needed/not needed?**_: Some processes will require decreasing friction in order to make them more efficient or accessible (particularly for beginners). On the other hand, it can also be important to introduce friction to slow certain processes down, especially in order to consider intention, inclusivity, and accessibility.
-   _**What is clear/not clear?:**_ A lot of informal knowledge gets passed on at community calls and/or builds over time. However, this means that as the project has expanded, 1:1 knowledge transfer isn't as possible, and may create barriers for newcomers to the project. What is clear for possible contributors? What is not?
-   _**How to leave time for asynchronous feedback?**_:

The 'Trainers & Mentors' and 'Reviewers & Editors' 

We also formalised a working group for Translation and Localisation, a sub-community that had formed organically in the previous two years. For groups meeting for the first time, we helped to set up their meeting infrastructure: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. At times we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and with others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. Looking back on that time, it became clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown.

### 🌀 Emergence:
* I'd like to formalise this research into a 'toolkit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members, and graphs for 


## Phase 3: Supporting, Sharing & Expanding Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, a few changes occurred in our time. Our co-PI, Kirstie Whitaker (alongside Malvika Sharan) returned from maternity leave. We also added a new member to our team, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, who joined at the Research Project Manager. This meant that we started organising ourselves. 

During this time, I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a templatable way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see a PR I finally made with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!), and we also moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way). This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project.

We also started giving lots of talks with community members across the project:

## Phase 4: Iterating, Documenting and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - Ongoing )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning the Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. This was a testing ground for another working group, this time oriented around a community event (like a planning committee!). We invited different community members and used this space to trial learnings from the first two working groups, with more support for meeting infrastructure.
