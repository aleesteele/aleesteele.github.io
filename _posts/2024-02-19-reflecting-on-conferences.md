_04.04.24: I started writing this blog from thet train back from Brussels. The prompt to reflect more broadly on all the conferences I've been able to attend over the past few years, which you can read more about here._ 

# Experiencing (open) culture(s) en Bruxelles: from Transmediale to FOSDEM

I first came to Brussels in March 2022 for the Rendering Research workshop at Transmediale, an annual festival for art and digital culture that usually takes place in Berlin. Miriam Mathiessen, my collaborator at the time was there with me. We learned about , and shared a presentation about [ideologies that shape open knowledge projects](), later publishing an "anti-paper" about open knowledge and maintenance approaches to knowledge-making. 

During that trip, we saw a version of the city that more closely resembled the Bruxelles that Miriam grew up with (while not Belgian, she spent the majority of her life in the city). At this workshop, we made risographs for the first time, and learned that a university website can be [hosted on a wiki](https://wiki.erg.be/m/), and that

In December of that same year, my flight back to North America states from London was delayed for hours, then cancelled for the evening. I spent a night at the hostel near the Brussels airport, and have strong memories of having a beer while Christmas music.

In 2023, I returned in a very different capacity, this time as Community Manager of The Turing Way project. Here, I gave a [talk]() about the project, my first in-person conference talk in quite a few months more broadly! 

It was also my first time being at such a big conference since before the pandemic, and I remember the shock I'd had at being in stadium-like spaces for the Keynotes, and X. At the time, there was a photo exhibit outside of the main stage, where X.

It was in the ". 

You see – I'd "been" to FOSDEM previously, just no to this room at the University of Bruxelles. I first attended the online conference in 2022, through the recommendation of Lily Winfree, then the coordinator of the Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellowship that I was a part of. 

I had heard a lot about Brussels in the

**1. That 2020-2021 period was key for conferences and connections**
I knew this implicitly, but after listing all of these events, one thing that sticks out to me was how important the 2020-2021 period of remote conferences was. Without _really_ knowing anything, I had applied and presented at conferences that would have been wildly out of scope or budget for me today. I probably wouldn't even be where I am now!

We've talked a lot about how online conferences have made, but they were also really important for early career researchers like myself. At these digital spaces, I was able to connect with folks in ways I wouldn't otherwise. However, that only really worked because everyone else was online, too. 

I probably wouldn't be where I am now (not that I know much more!) without the opportunity to participate in these spaces.

**2. The cadence of conferences really changed post-pandemic, and it took us awhile to find our footing again (and to combat the burnout that period created).**

At the same, the cadence of conferences took on a different (and perhaps more confusing cadense) when all conference moved online and then.

I joined The Turing Way team when this happened – when the combinat.

Many folks I 

**3. Conferences and festivals are the rituals of our time.**

I'm reminded of something I read in Gabriella Coleman's book "Coding Freedom", when she notes that "conferences are the rituals of our time" (or something like that), and it totally blew my mind. 

Returning to spaces like MozFest and . 

**4. Conferences are always better with others (either in-person or online!)**

This is an obvious one.

**5. Conferences are a place where different social groups overlap**

I find it super 

**6. Post conference-care is key**

Last year, I got really tired. I attended a number of conferences back to back. Towards the end of the year, I started prioritising personal time over professional travel, which really shifted. 

Perhaps most contraversially, I
