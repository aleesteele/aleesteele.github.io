2025 was an important year. I ended my role at the Alan Turing Institute, and began freelancing for the first time in my career.

Freelancing is rewarding but challenging, and I'm pursuing this path for a few reasons, one of which is that I'm making the time and space for two pieces of work that require a substantial amount of time.

In 2026, I’m working on two projects very close to the heart. One lives in institutions, the other in mountains, but I’m increasingly convinced that they’re the same project, or rather variations on a theme.

1. **The first is about ecosystems connection**. With the Software Sustainability Institute, I’ll be seeding connections between the worlds of academic computing and creative computation, both of which think about digital research and outputs very differently.  [Please fill out this form is you’re interested in being either interviewed or participating in the project]([https://tinyurl.com/ssi-ac-art-computing](https://tinyurl.com/ssi-ac-art-computing)). 

2. **The other is a personal project**. I'm planning a digital and physical walk across the Baekdudaegan, a mountain range that crosses the Korean peninsula. Physical in the sense that there are 687km (427 miles) to walk in September, digital in the sense that I will be using satellite imagery and other open data in order to investigate the northern half of the route. Stay tuned for the new issue of [HTML review](https://thehtml.review/), as I’ll have a piece there on the project. 

Re-reading my principles of [2024](https://www.aleesteele.com/blog/2024/01/05/principles) and [2025](https://www.aleesteele.com/blog/2025/01/05/2025-principles), it almost feels like I have been building towards this year for a while now.

Wish me luck – I'll need it!
