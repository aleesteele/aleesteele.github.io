2025 was an important year. I ended my role at the Alan Turing Institute, and began freelancing for the first time in my career!

I'm doing this for two reasons. This year, I’m working on two projects very close to the heart. One lives in institutions, the other in mountains, but I’m increasingly convinced that they’re the same project.

1. The first is about ecosystems connection. With the Software Sustainability Institute, I’ll be seeding connections between the worlds of academic computing and creative computation, both of which think about digital life very differently. I’ve learned so much from artists about how we might imagine a better world, and conversely, spending time with academic researchers has shown me the kinds of expansive questions that require public funding. Please fill out this form is you’re interested in being either interviewed or participating in the project. 

2. The other is a personal project: a digital and physical walk across the Baekdudaegan, a mountain range that crosses the Korean penninsula. I’ve been wanting to combine the different parts of myself for a long time:. Stay tuned for the new issue of HTML review, as I’ll have a piece there on the project.
