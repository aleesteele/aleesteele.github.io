Dear all,

I recently published another piece for _The Graduate Press_, a student-run publication here at The Graduate Institute, titled <a href="https://thegraduatepress.org/2020/11/16/who-writes-the-first-draft-of-history/">"Who writes the first draft of history"</a>

The piece draws from my lived experience working in journalism and media, and increasingly, my exposure to the open technology ecosystem.

Always,

A
