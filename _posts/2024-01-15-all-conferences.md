# All the (open) events I have attended from 2021-2024

One of my regrets from 2021-2023 (just an observation -  not a punitive one!) is that I wasn't ever able to write down learnings or observations from the different conferences and festivals I have been _deeply_ privileged (in both time and in capital) to attend over the past few years, all quite different in audience and scope.

Here's a list of all the research and/or practice-oriented festivals/conferences I have either attended in full or presented at over the past few years. I might have forgotten a few, but I've added the ones where I either have presented a talk, and/or have joined a workshop or event (or it was particularly memorable). The grouping of 'festival' and 'conference' is semantic, but they generally involve research and technology ([in a broad sense](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology)).

Listing all of these conferences took me across a few different mediums: from twitter (when I used it as a public note-taking tool) to youtube, to personal notes and more. I've linked a few, if anything for myself.

| Talk  |  Time  |  Mode  |  Notes |  
|------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| FOSDEM  |  Feb 2021 | 💻 - remote | As a part of my MA research, I tuned into this conference online as I saw many OSMers were attending. I ended up listening to a [talk by Maya Anderson-González](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/open_research_floss_meet_social_science/) that shifted my perspective on the relationship between F/LOSS and social science, and made me think that I could find a space in it too.  |  
| Open Data Days | Mar 2021  |  💻 - remote | I designed the [poster](https://twitter.com/CultureDoug/status/1366390258431119363) & helped to find speakers with a few [Frictionless Fellows](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1365005658739929088). I think this might have been the first time I presented in a public forum online.  |  
|  Mozilla Festival |  Mar 2021 |  💻 - remote | Facilitated a discussion about [supply chains](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1368156022033051650) with Miriam Matthiessen, solidifying a collaboration we had at that time. We ended up applying to the UNLOCK Accelerator with Wikimedia Deutschland, and learned a lot. This was my first time organizing and facilitating an experimental workshop like this (and wouldn't have been possible without Miriam!).  |
| Sustainability Week Switzerland | Mar 2021 |  💻 - remote | Joined the organising team for this student-led conference & moderated a [panel about Gross National Happiness](https://twitter.com/kmjefford/status/1375041795827060743) with speakers from Switzerland and Bhutan (where I studied abroad as an undergrad). This was my first time moderating a panel more broadly, and really felt like I was connecting influential experiences from my BA & MA together.
| csv,CONF | May 2021 |  💻 - remote | This conference was [similar to the previous one](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1389970868273569794). Uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4739237) for the first time. This conference exposed me to a lot of amazing projects in the open ecosystem, and new ways of thinking about data more broadly as a practitioner. It was insanely surreal to follow a talk by Creative Commons CEO Catherine Stihler – I was just an MA student at the time and really felt like I had "made it". I even applied to a job whose project I first learned about through csv,CONF.

I (or we - as a team) were rejected from:
- RightsCon 2023

After listing all of these events out One thing that sticks out was how 2021 was a period in which which gave me the opportunity. Without _really_ knowing anything, I applied and presented at conferences that I know now were probably wildly outside of my comfort zone . At the same time, I probably wouldn't be where I am now (not that I know much more!) without the opportunity to participate in these spaces. It is a deep privilege (on) 

It was (and remains) a deep privilege to be able to attend and to partake in these spaces in their physical space, especially in the years after the pandemic lockdowns and deep isolation, followed by the precarious economic times we now find ourselves in. 

Perhaps some of the most impactful talks I have

These were all very different places – and of course different from workshops given, or talks series I might have taken part of or organised.
