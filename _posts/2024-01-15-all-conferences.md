# All the (open) events I have attended from 2021-2024

One of my regrets from 2021-2023 (just an observation -  not a punitive one!) is that I wasn't ever able to write down learnings or observations from the different conferences and festivals I have been _deeply_ privileged (in both time and in capital) to attend over the past few years, all quite different in audience and scope.

Here's a list of all the research and/or practice-oriented festivals/conferences I have either attended in full or presented at over the past few years. I might have forgotten a few, but I've added the ones where I either have presented a talk, and/or have joined a workshop or event (or it was particularly memorable). The grouping of 'festival' and 'conference' is semantic, but they generally involve research and technology ([in a broad sense](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology)).

Listing all of these conferences took me across a few different mediums: from twitter (when I used it as a public note-taking tool) to youtube, to personal notes and more. I've linked a few, if anything for myself. This was a really useful exercise, as it put into perspective how far I've come (and also, how much *tacit* knowledge I learned in each of these spaces).

| Talk  |  Time  |  Mode  |  Notes |  
|------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| FOSDEM  |  Feb 2021 | 💻 - remote | As a part of my MA research, I tuned into this conference online as I saw many OSMers were attending. I ended up listening to a [talk by Maya Anderson-González](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/open_research_floss_meet_social_science/) that shifted my perspective on the relationship between F/LOSS and social science, and made me think that I could find a space in it too.  |  
| Open Data Days | Mar 2021  |  💻 - remote | I designed the [poster](https://twitter.com/CultureDoug/status/1366390258431119363) & helped to find speakers with a few [Frictionless Fellows](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1365005658739929088). I think this might have been the first time I presented in a public forum online.  |  
|  Mozilla Festival |  Mar 2021 |  💻 - remote | Facilitated a discussion about [supply chains](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1368156022033051650) with Miriam Matthiessen, solidifying a collaboration we had at that time. We ended up applying to the UNLOCK Accelerator with Wikimedia Deutschland, and learned a lot. This was my first time organizing and facilitating an experimental workshop like this (and wouldn't have been possible without Miriam!).  |
| Sustainability Week Switzerland | Mar 2021 |  💻 - remote | Joined the organising team for this student-led conference & moderated a [panel about Gross National Happiness](https://twitter.com/kmjefford/status/1375041795827060743) with speakers from Switzerland and Bhutan (where I studied abroad as an undergrad). This was my first time moderating a panel more broadly, and really felt like I was connecting influential experiences from my BA & MA together. A full circle moment.
| csv,CONF | May 2021 |  💻 - remote | This conference was honestly quite [similar to the previous one](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1389970868273569794). Uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4739237) for the first time. This conference exposed me to a lot of amazing projects in the open ecosystem, and new ways of thinking about open source/data/government more broadly as a practitioner. It was insanely surreal to follow a talk by Creative Commons CEO Catherine Stihler – I was just another MA student at the time, and really felt like I had "made it". I even applied to a job whose project I first learned about through csv,CONF.
| RightsCon | June 2021 |  💻 - remote | Recorded a talk for this conference. It really felt like our relationship with online conference hit a wall around this time – as I remember engagement being quite low. It felt like walls of content - and while there were so many important stories to be shared, 
| GRiSTS | Oct 2021 |  💻 - remote |  This was my first* academic conference, and where I presented my [work-in-progress MA research](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/event/grists-conference-10-28-21) for the first time outside of my programme. I was terrified, and remember being placed with speakers . I remember tuning into the other speakers, 
| HOT Summit | Nov 2021 | 💻 - remote |  Shared work-in-progress research from my MA
| Transmediale Rendering Research | Mar 2022 |  💻 - remote & 🏛️ - in-person | This 
| Internet Society Community Day | Jul 2022 | 💻 - remote | 
| Connected Life | July 2022 | 🏛️ - in-person | Presented research from my fellowship with the [internet society](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1539523538821996545), the first time i've done an academic presentation in person!
| State of the Map | Aug 2022 | 🏛️ - in-person | Shared my [MA research](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1560560865740750849) with the OpenStreetMap community 
| DIY Methods | Sep 2022 | 💌 - mail | This is perhaps the most creative conference I have ever participated in. I made a . It really challenged my ways of thinking about academic 
| Research for Genomics Equity | Oct 2022 | 🏛️ - in-person |
| Big Team Science | Oct 2022 | Co-facilitated a workshop around [research infrastructure roles](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1585287851469586432) |
| FOSDEM | Feb 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person | It was wild to return to Brussels in a completely different capacity. I remember being distinctly overwhelmed by the size. It was also a joy to be invited to return – and to possible help organise the following year... little did I know. 
| State of Open Con | Feb 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person |
| Open Data Days | Mar 2023 | 💻 - remote | This was the first of a few collaborations with Jennifer Ding, my colleague whose work focused on AI. We had been trading perspectives over the past few months, and this was the first time we piloted an 'experimental' workshop about participatory AI/data practices that applied some of the interactive workshop experience I'd had from my experiments with Miriam.
| FOSS Backstage | Mar 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person | This was one of my favorite talks that I gave last year, with Danny Garside. We talked about the ethos of maintenance, and what that meant for the TTW project.
| AI-UK | Mar 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person |
| Mozilla Festival | Mar 2023 |  💻 - remote  | Hilariously, I think I gave this workshop with Jennifer Ding in the volunteer staff room of AI-UK, as the two had overlapping dates. This conference
| Feeling Machines | Apr 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person |
| Data Justice | Apr 2023 |  🏛️ - in-person  |
| Open Science and Social Justice | Jul 2023 | ❌ - didn't attend | I remember having discussions with my colleague about.
| Collaborations Workshop | May 2023 |  🏛️ - in-person  |
| Moving frontiers of the demos | Jun 2023 |  |
| Venice Biennale Festival | Jul 2023 |  |
| London Data Week | Jul 2023 | ❌ - didn't attend | I remember having discussions with my colleague about.
| Festival of OpenREF | Oct 2023 | ❌ - didn't attend | The REF (and HiddenREF initiative) was one of the first UK-research initiatives I heard about after joining the Turing. While I couldn't join this event, I was a part of planning processes (and learned about the ecosystem of folks that circulate around the event.)
| Big Team Science | Oct 2023 | 💻 - remote  | I returned to BTS this year, this time with two other folks (Esther Plomp and Danny Garside) to give an "anti-panel" about. 
| Hack the Hackathon 3.0 | Nov 2023 | 🏛️ - in-person | I was invited to 
| AI Safety Summit Fringe events | Nov 2023 | ❌ - didn't attend | While I witnessded, 

*Previously, I had given only one academic presentation at the end of my BA back in 2017, at a gathering of officials in Thimphu, Bhutan (but that's another story)...

**1. That 2020-2021 period was key for conferences and connections**
I knew this implicitly, but after listing all of these events out, one thing that sticks out was how imporant the 2020-2021 period of remote conferences was. Without _really_ knowing anything, I had applied and presented at conferences that would have been wildly out of scope or budget for me today. 

We've talked a lot about how conference,s but they were also really important for early career researchers like myself to get traction and make. However, that only really worked because everyone else was online, too. 

I probably wouldn't be where I am now (not that I know much more!) without the opportunity to participate in these spaces.

**2. The cadence of conferences really changed post-pandemic.**

At the same, the cadence of conferences took on a different (and perhaps more confusing tune) when the event moved online.

**3. Conferences and festivals are the rituals of our time.**

I'm reminded of something I read in Gabriella Coleman's book "Coding Freedom", when she notes that "conferences are the rituals of our time" (or something like that), and it totally blew my mind. 

Returning to spaces like MozFest and 

**4. Conferences are always better with others (either in-person or online!)**

This is an obvious one.
