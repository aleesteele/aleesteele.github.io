Here's a list of all the research and/or practice-oriented festivals/conferences over the past few years. I could the ones where I have presented a talk, and/or have joined a evs. The grouping of these two is semantic, but the themes of . They tend to involve (sharing) research, (creating and/or critiquing) technology, and . I don't count the one-off workshops or .

At the same time, I probably wouldn't be where I am now (not that I know much more!) without the opportunity to participate in these spaces. It is a deep privilege (on)
