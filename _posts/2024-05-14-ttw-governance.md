_Note: I recently wrote this decision about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for a former colleague and friend Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups. In the time since, I've expanded it into this broader blog, expanded to account for the different stages of governance that I've gone through alongside The Turing Way community._ 

# How have we formalised governance within _The Turing Way_?

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or  management) and they'll all say the same thing: governance is *hard*! 

I thought I’d tell you a little bit about how I've tried to go about forming working groups with The Turing Way project, and formalised work within the project more broadly. I don't want to pretend that this effort came from me alone  – it absolutely was a team effort! 

You'll notice that there's a lot of focus on working groups in this summary. That's not to say that our governance has translated exclusively into working groups, it's simply one of the most visible outcomes of our governance work within the community, along with other structures. Under each stage, I've drawn from the ["pluses and deltas"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/templates/template-bookdash-feedback#ch-template-bookdash-feedback) reflection format we tend to use for Book Dash: aka positive learnings/outcomes as well as things I would change in retrospect.

Keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats (monthly in 2022, bi-monthly in 2023, quarterly in 2024), giving trainings and talks, maintaining the existing repository, and institution, collaborating with internal teams at the Turing (the community management and skills teams in particular), and more. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.

Finally, each of these stages weren't explicitly planned, as we've very much tried to [move at the speed of trust](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk) within the community, adjusting to needs as they emerged. Hindsight is also always 2020. 

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

I joined the project in March 2022, and spent the [first 6 months learning more about the project](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/discussions/2552) which you can read more about on that issue. 

This culminated in realising that there were identifiable workstreams within the project that could be formalised into ‘working groups’ to help field support and agency in the growing project (and prevent the [tyranny of structurelessness]()), taking cues from the models of other open source communities (and other forms of social organisation). This research into governance was pretty informal (like this [slide deck of research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcKjeikxAAfKDCb5Okh1EqPbabedM3c7xIVuKv1Cqeg/edit#slide=id.p)), and also formal as well (like when [we participated in the Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-5/projects-participants.html))... And it’s been a bumpy road, but a huge learning experience! 

I'm aiming to formalise this research into a 'tool kit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members that could apply more broadly to other people learning about their communities. 
#### Pluses:
- Rapid reporting through weekly ritual
- Bottoms-up observation of community needs
#### Delta:
- Format for reporting was informal  
- Frequency and length of reporting lead to burnout

## Phase 2: Trialling Community Governance Structures aka Working Groups and Core Team (Sept 2022 - March 2023)

The following 6 months (Sept 2022 - March 2023) were spent working on supporting the trialing of 4 working groups: Trainers & Mentors, Reviewers & Editors, Infrastructure, and Accessibility. These were done on different timelines. 

The 'Trainers & Mentors' and 'Reviewers & Editors' group were etablished with members of Turing staff, and other folks who had time from their paid roles to work on the project. I'm currently writing a blog about what we learned from this process - which I'll make sure to cross cite. 

We also formalised a working group for Translation and Localisation, a sub-community that had formed organically in the previous two years. We also put the pieces in place to establish a Infrastructure Working Group and Accessibility Working Group, building off of ongoing work and conversations within the community that had been observed to be ongoing. 

For groups meeting for the first time, we helped to set up their meeting infrastructure: aims, project ideas, meeting notes, and other bits and bobs. At times we gave over the reins too early (and they felt they had no support or guidance for their work), and with others, we’ve held on to the reins perhaps a bit too tightly. 

Looking back on that time, it became clear that this is what [moving at the speed of trust looks like](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk), to quote adrienne marie brown. 
#### Pluses:
- Quickly established groups
- Working Group worked as organising structure
#### Delta:
- Support was spread too thin for new groups
- No rapid process to test feedback or iterate 
## Phase 3: Supporting & Expanding Community Infrastructure  (March 2023 - Sept 2023)

From March 2023 to September 2023, I started preparing documentation needed to help with this formalisation in a template-able way for other similar groups to form working groups ([you can see a PR I finally made with some of this info here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3499)!). 

Lead by the Infrastructure Working Group, we moved into a github organisation (from a repository), which has allowed different groups to [have their own spaces/repositories](https://github.com/the-turing-way) . This has helped with increased autonomy and increased decentralisation of the project as we continued to grow.

One of the key changes during this time was also a change in staff: Alexandra Araujo Alvarez joined me as a Project Manager for _The Turing Way_, and it was together that we were able to support these growing pains across the project. Kirstie Whitaker, the founder of the project and lead of the Tools, Practices & Systems programme at the Turing, also returned after a year of maternity leave.

The Core Team meetings, also known as Community Calls continued to be hosted but were refashioned as feedback sessions, specifically oriented around giving space for project and community leadership to gather to reimagine governance.

_The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub was also launched formally during this time, which brought up other questions within the community about how parallel projects interact with community leadership. 
#### Pluses:
- Met growing need for expansion within community
- Increased autonomy for community leadership (especially working groups)
#### Delta:
- Maintenance responsibilities increased overall across project
- Decision-making process for splitting original repository slow to be established 

## Phase 4: Iterating and Decentralising Governance Structures (Sept 2023 - February 2024 )

From September to December 2023, we were conceptualising and planning our 10th Book Dash, our biannual contribution event. 

This was a testing ground for two unique organising structures within the community: a long term Book Dash Working Group, and a temporary event-specific Planning Committee. Both of these groups involve different community members. In planning the November 2023 Book Dash, we were able to trial learnings from the previous working groups and our history of hosting different events within the community.

Two meeting styles were retired during this time. The final core team meeting was held in September, after two years of quarterly meetings, and was sunsetted. The final working group share-out was organised in November. It became clear that while these meeting spaces had been important as a mechanism to formalise existing work in the community, these spaces were increasingly not seen to be open to newcomers. There was clearly a need to create a new space!

Around this time, we also saw increased interest in The Turing Way Practitioner's Hub, which culminated in a Fireside Chat event in December 2023. 
#### Pluses:
- Book Dash Working Group-led event (our 10th Book Dash!) was a success!
- Ongoing meeting structures solidifed for working groups
#### Deltas:
- Organisational documentation requires time for review
- Reporting across community silos required different meeting structure

## Phase 5: Maintaining Community Structures and Developing Onboarding (February 2024 - Ongoing)

Since February 2024, we've been in the process of maintaining the structures we currently have within the community, and focusing on how we might be able to support them after a few years of iteration: i.e. planning our 11th Book Dash, organising maintainers within the project, and continuing with our usual community programming.

We've also had two new community calls emerge this year. 

One is called the Community Forum, where folks from different parts of the project share learnings and questions from their work. This call replaced our previous governance community calls like the Core Team Meeting and Working Group Shareouts, the latter of which originally took place during the Book Dash.

The second is a regular onboarding call, for folks interested in learning more about the community and project who are looking for a softer onboarding onto the project. These have been well-attended, and speak to the need to refocus on bringing newcomers into the project, after a couple of years focused primarily on maintainers.

The Turing Way has also gone through a couple of changes in staff this year! Alex moved to a new role in an aligned project, and Aoife Hughes joined for a temporary secondment with _The Turing Way_. 
#### Pluses:
- New community reporting structure emerged (Community Forum)
- Structures have solidified across existing community
#### Deltas:
- Reviewing writing is slow - and takes a long time!
- Need to re-focus on newcomers to project
## So, how did we do it?

Maybe it's the anthropologist in me, but beginning with what already existed in the community was a starting point I came back to again and again and again in helping to incubate our governance. Beginning with formalisation, then iterating on the structures and process that emerged from that helped us to work within the existing culture and structures (i.e. community calls) in the community that existed before I joined. 
#### What would I do differently?
1. **Develop ways of receiving and acting on feedback**: When incubating these structures, gathering feedback happened in informal calls as well as in broader community calls. Both types helped us to gather feedback on community structures regularly with psychological safety in mind for community members. However, in retrospect, we could have developed structures to do this more regularly and clearly with established questions. But I also suppose: we didn't know at the time the types questions that needed to be asked to receive more specific feedback. 
2. **Document regularly, document often**: After the public community research process, the documentation for these past few years of governance work within The Turing Way has become more ad-hoc! Our documentation lives on in a couple of different places, as we have shifted our underlying infrastructure as well from HackMD to pad, and I also learned about the different types of documentation that The Turing Way contains in its guides. Condensing all of this into a narrative format that makes sense required navigating these different archives. 
3. **Plan for longer timelines, always:** The beginning of the project revealed many learnings about the project that in many ways, still apply today. While the early community research and audit process surfaced many questions, developing the structures to address these questions, concerns, desires, and dreams simply takes time. And it always takes more time than you expect. 

There will undoubtedly be other types of learnings that I'll make sure to post here. But more broadly, I hope this process helps someone else who might be incubating governance within their own open source community.
