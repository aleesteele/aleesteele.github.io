_Note: I recently wrote this decision about formalising working groups for governance with The Turing Way for a former colleague and friend Gracielle Higino's lab meeting at the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS2). They were going through a similar process, and while I wasn't able to attend the meeting, I drafted a short summary of the process of creating working groups. In the time since, I've expanded it into this broader blog, expanded to account for the different stages of governance that I've gone through alongside The Turing Way community._ 

# How have we formalised governance within _The Turing Way_?

Talk to anyone in the open source space (or really anyone who has experience with organisational governance, community organising, or  management) and they'll all say the same thing: governance is *hard*! 

I thought I’d tell you a little bit about how I've tried to go about forming working groups with The Turing Way project, and formalised work within the project more broadly. I don't want to pretend that this effort came from me alone  – it absolutely was a team effort! 

Previously we had a full published blog here - but are releasing this work as an official briefing, with a short summery here!
