# On Governance (or how I stopped worrying and learned how to love the process) - Part 2

A few notes about this writing process as well:
- You'll notice that there's a lot of focus on working groups in this summary. That's not to say that our governance has translated exclusively into working groups, it's simply one of the most visible outcomes of our governance work within the community, along with other structures. 
- Each of these stages weren't explicitly planned, as we've very much tried to [move at the speed of trust](https://www.rootedstrategy.com/blogposts/4w6myxde5a15j0zrtybcgf3a1mbktk)  within the community, adjusting to needs as they emerged. 
- Under each stage, I've drawn from the ["pluses and deltas"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/templates/template-bookdash-feedback#ch-template-bookdash-feedback) reflection format we tend to use for Book Dash: aka positive learnings/outcomes as well as things I would change in retrospect. 
- For those interested in starting a similar process, please keep in mind that this governance work was done alongside the other operational tasks within the project like hosting Fireside Chats, giving trainings and talks, onboarding, reporting and more of the day-to-day operations of the project. The timelines might have been different if this were my full-time focus.
- I also want to stress that this effort also did not come from me alone. It has absolutely has been a team effort, and I've learned tons from my fellow colleauges and collaborators about the process!

## Phase 1: Community Research (March 2022 - Sept 2022)

### âž• Pluses:
- **This weekly ritual helped me to get to know the the community (and allowed the community to get to know me!)**: This weekly ritual was something I was immediately decided. It ensured I got to know community members through "snowball sampling"
- **Weekly reporting is transparency in action**: Weekly reporting was hard, but it ensured. Translating conversations into 
- 

### ðŸ”ºDeltas:
- **The reporting format was too informal**: I started documenting this work informally on Github because of . While this played the role of, it also meant that this work wasn't necessarily visible to others that might be engaging in different formats, and was not 
- **Develop a timeline and end-date**: As an ethnographer, the outcome was clear: learn about the community, but the output wasn't as clear: was it a platform audit? A community audit? A design research exercise? A combination of all of the above? I indeed wanted to use a combination of the tools I already knew (ethnography)
- **De-scope as needed ** 
- **Watch out for burnout**: While the weekly ritual allowed for me to learn a *lot* about TTW quickly, it also happened at an unsustainable piece. After months of repoI got pretty burnt out in the autumn, 

I'd like to formalise this research into a 'toolkit' that others can use, with sample ecosystem questions, interview questions for key stakeholders and community members, and graphs for
