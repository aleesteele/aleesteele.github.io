_15.01.2024: Wow, what a joy!__

--

Wow, what a year! I can confidently say that I've adhered to habits 

> **1. Move more: get out of the head and into the body.**

I want this year to be a year of movement - not the kind that took me around the world and back this past year - but rather the kind that allows me to find space in myself (wherever I am). Some of my best thinking has happened on long runs, swims, gardening, boxing, hikes, climbing, yoga. And sometimes I didn’t have a conscious thought at all (bliss!). I want to cultivate this habit from a place of self-compassion instead of punitive self-discipline, and make sure to move (if only a little!) at least once a day. Milestones like marathons and personal records mean less than a consistent practice of movement, however small.

> **2. Be mindful of my attention - and train the muscle that allows me to sustain it.**



> **3. Embrace a beginner’s mindset, and create more: frequently and earnestly without too much self-criticism.**
