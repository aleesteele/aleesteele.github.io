_15.01.2024: Wow, we've made it.__

--

Wow, what a year! I can confidently say that I've adhered to habits here. 

> **1. Move more: get out of the head and into the body.**

> **2. Be mindful of my attention - and train the muscle that allows me to sustain it.**

> **3. Embrace a beginner’s mindset, and create more: frequently and earnestly without too much self-criticism.**

> **4. Don’t be afraid of solitude, but don’t let it relapse into rumination.**

One of my big critiques of life in London was that it was so easy to default to consuming creating - attending countless events

> **5. Hard things don’t last forever - move through the discomfort required to grow.**

And by this, I literally mean move! When you’re stuck in rumination, get out of your mind. Eat well. Treat your body well.

>**6. Be guided by curiosity, not by fear.**

I started off this year with a good dose of fear.
