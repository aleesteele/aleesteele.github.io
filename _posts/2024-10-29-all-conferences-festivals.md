_**Note 11/2:** I haven't added all the links to recordings or slides. I'll aim to add those soon, but in the meantime, have just added this as a new column._

Here's a list of all the research and/or practice-oriented festivals/conferences I have either attended in full or presented at over the past few years. 

I might have forgotten a few, but I've added the ones where I either have presented a talk, and/or have joined a workshop or event (or it was particularly memorable - and seems apt to add here). The grouping of 'festival' and 'conference' is semantic, but they generally involve research and technology ([in a broad sense](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology)). There are a few exceptions to this: The Turing Way's Fireside Chats from 2022, 2023 and 2024 (which I lead organised alongside many others), as well as our bi-annual Book Dashes. These are quite different events (especially as an organiser), and I'd like to write about them separately.

Reviewing all of these events took me across a few different mediums: from twitter (when I used it as a public note-taking tool) to youtube, to personal notes and more. I've linked a few, if anything for myself.

| FOSDEM                                                     | Feb 2021       | üíª - remote                   | As a part of my MA research, I tuned into this conference online as I saw many OSMers were attending. I ended up listening to a [talk by Maya Anderson-Gonz√°lez](https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/open_research_floss_meet_social_science/) that shifted my perspective on the relationship between F/LOSS and social science, and made me think that I could find a space in 'open source' too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |
| Open Data Days                                             | Mar 2021       | üíª - remote                   | I designed the [poster](https://twitter.com/CultureDoug/status/1366390258431119363) & helped to find speakers with a few [Frictionless Fellows](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1365005658739929088). I think this might have been the first time I presented in a public forum online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                    |
| Mozilla Festival                                           | Mar 2021       | üíª - remote                   | Facilitated a discussion about [supply chains](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1368156022033051650) with Miriam Matthiessen, solidifying a collaboration we had at that time. We ended up applying to the UNLOCK Accelerator with Wikimedia Deutschland, and learned a lot. This was my first time organizing and facilitating an experimental workshop like this (and wouldn't have been possible without Miriam!).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                    |
| Sustainability Week Switzerland                            | Mar 2021       | üíª - remote                   | Joined the organising team for this student-led conference & moderated a [panel about Gross National Happiness](https://twitter.com/kmjefford/status/1375041795827060743) with speakers from Switzerland and Bhutan (where I studied abroad as an undergrad). This was my first time moderating a panel more broadly, and really felt like I was connecting influential experiences from my BA & MA together. A full circle moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                    |
| csv,CONF                                                   | May 2021       | üíª - remote                   | This conference was honestly quite [similar to the previous one](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1389970868273569794). Uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4739237) for the first time. This conference exposed me to a lot of amazing projects in the open ecosystem, and new ways of thinking about open source/data/government more broadly as a practitioner. It was insanely surreal to follow a talk by Creative Commons CEO Catherine Stihler ‚Äì¬†I was just another MA student at the time, and really felt like I had "made it". I even applied to a job whose project I first learned about through csv,CONF. |                    |
| RightsCon                                                  | June 2021      | üíª - remote                   | Recorded a talk for this conference. It really felt like our relationship with online conference hit a wall around this time¬†‚Äì¬†as I remember engagement being quite low on the platform AccessNow created for it. We were all a bit burnt out of our screens at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                    |
| GRiSTS                                                     | Oct 2021       | üíª - remote                   | This was my first* academic conference, and where I presented my [work-in-progress MA research](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/event/grists-conference-10-28-21) for the first time outside of my programme. I was terrified, and remember being placed with speakers who _also_ seemed to straddle the line between critical study and practice. I remember tuning into the other speakers, and being initimidated by the clarity with which they were able to convey their research, but I also remember                                                                                                                                   |                    |
| HOT Summit                                                 | Nov 2021       | üíª - remote                   | This was the first time I shared my MA research _with_ folks in the OpenStreetMap (or in this case, the humanitarian mapping) community. The reaction I received at the time was so positive. I remember feeling nervous about how they would react to this critical work, but happy that anthropological studies were getting out of the academy and into the (digital) hands of people. I had looked to other social science researchers like [Martin Dittus and David Garcia](https://2019.stateofthemap.org/sessions/F9D8QG/), who had presented their work at State of the Map in 2019.                                            |                    |

We were based at an art school (that had a wiki for a homepage), and wrote about [maintenance as an ethos as researchers](https://aprja.net//article/view/134303), something that [really affected](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1525047942771576832) my approach to The Turing Way when I first joined the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                    |

It was really interesting to attend (alongside my colleague Jennifer Ding, who also shared her work), as it was the first time I realised how much my perspectives were changing as a 'practitioner' in open source, not only as a 'researcher'. Meaning I was interested in the outcome as much as the process.                                                                                                                         |                    |

I participated in a workshop about choreography by someone who I now feel lucky to call a friend named Joana Chicao.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                    |

*Previously, I had given only one academic presentation at the end of my BA back in 2017, at a gathering of officials in Thimphu, Bhutan (but that's another story)...

I also thought that it might be worth asking which conferences I _didn't_ attend as well, for a variety of reasons, because f:

Reflecting on the cadence of conferences

**1. That 2020-2021 period was key for conferences and connections**

I knew this implicitly, but after listing all of these events, one thing that sticks out to me was how important the 2020-2021 period of remote conferences was. Without _really_ knowing anything, I had applied and presented at conferences that would have been wildly out of scope or budget for me today. I probably wouldn't even be where I am now!

We've talked a lot about how online conferences have made, but they were also really important for early career researchers like myself. At these digital spaces, I was able to connect with folks in ways I wouldn't otherwise. However, that only really worked because everyone else was online, too. 

I probably wouldn't be where I am now (not that I know much more!) without the opportunity to participate in these spaces.

**2. The cadence of conferences really changed post-pandemic, and it took us awhile to find our footing again (and to combat the burnout that period created).**

At the same, the cadence of conferences took on a different (and perhaps more confusing cadense) when all conference moved online and then.

I joined The Turing Way team when this happened ‚Äì¬†when the combinat.

**3. Conferences and festivals are the rituals of our time.**

I'm reminded of something I read in Gabriella Coleman's book "Coding Freedom", when she notes that "conferences are the rituals of our time" (or something like that), and it totally blew my mind. 

Returning to spaces like MozFest and . 

**4. Conferences are always better with others (either in-person or online!)**

This is an obvious one.

**5. Conferences are a place where different social groups overlap**

I find it super 

**6. Post conference-care is key**

Last year, I got really tired. I attended a number of conferences back to back. Towards the end of the year, I started prioritising personal time over professional travel, which really shifted. 

Perhaps most contraversially, I
