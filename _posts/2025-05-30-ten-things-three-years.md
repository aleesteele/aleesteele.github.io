_Note: Back in August of 2022, I [wrote a blog]() that aimed to summarise some personal reflections about digital life, community management, and researcher/praxis reflections a year into my role with The Turing Way. As Jia Tolentino wrote in her book **Trick Mirror**: "I write to think", and for me, this is true as well. Journalistic or creative writing uses a very different set of muscles than documentation or academic writing, and as I finish off three years with the project, I wanted to document these broader reflections._

### 1. Community-building is not the same as understanding  the practices of community management.

I entered the 

### 2. Scientific research is not the same as technological development – their cultures, norms, and practices are different

One example where we see this is those on our team who have PhDs, and those who have worked in 'industry'. 

### 3. Teaching and facilitation is an art and a practice 

In the 

### 4. Balancing the requirements of maintenance and the generativity of creativity is hard.



### 5. Difference matters as much as it has the space it has to flourish.

I've thought about this one a lot!
### 6. Intergenerational histories and myths are really important in sustaining the culture of an open source project. 



### 7. Being in community with each other requires suspending some amount of disbelief – and critique. It requires simply being together.


### 8. Transparency and trust are interlinked, but are not the same thing.


### 9. Sustaining third spaces for others does not necessarily create a third space for yourself.

Last autumn, I wrote about third spaces. 

### 10. Community building is in the small things: rituals are important

### In summary?

It's funny how so many of these


- What you share is as important as how you share
- Community building is in the small things: rituals are important
- Openness alone isn't enough
- Teaching and facilitation are an art and a practice
- So many movements have so much to learn from open science
- Integrating critique can render solution making difficult
- Balancing maintenance and generative creativity
- Who is heard (and who is not) 
- You cannot be everywhere at once -- all information in partial
- why is art always cornered into a "let's think about ethics" corner?
- Behaviour of being open is a habit - and a practice
- creating third spaces for otehrs does not create a third space for yourself
- open "AI" has shifted the landscape and priorities of openness - not necessarily for the better
- Being in community with each other requires suspending some amount of disbelief – and critique. It requires simply "being together"
- You cannot manage a community from the margins (as a community manager) – but you can seek to bring other perspectives in support it.
- Intergenerational knowledge (and multigenerational) is a complex, 
- Being "in the arena" looks very different depending on your discipline (and requires very different muscles!)
- Education is liberatory – but that liberation looks very different for different people. What are we 
- Open science for many is a deeply personal experience. 
- Intergernational histories and myths are really important in sustaining the history of a project. 
- Transparency and trust are interlinked, but are not the same thing
- Going beyond traditional research outputs looks very different depending on the space you are in
- The Turing Way is a pulse on the wider research field
- Difference matters as much as the space you give it to flourish
