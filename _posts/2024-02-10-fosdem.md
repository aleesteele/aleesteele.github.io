# Experiencing (open) culture(s) en Bruxelles: from Transmediale to FOSDEM

I first came to Brussels in March 2022 for the Rendering Research workshop at Transmediale, an annual festival for art and digital culture that usually takes place in Berlin. Miriam Mathiessen, my collaborator at the time was there with me. We shared a presentation about [ideologies that shape open knowledge projects](), later publishing an "anti-paper" about open knowledge and maintenance approaches to knowledge-making. 

During that trip, we saw a version of the city that more closely resembled the Bruxelles that Miriam grew up with (while not Belgian, she spent the majority of her life in the city). At this workshop, we made risographs for the first time, and learned that a university website can be [hosted on a wiki](https://wiki.erg.be/m/), and that clothes make great lampshades.

In December of that same year, my flight back to North America states from London was delayed for hours, then cancelled for the evening. I spent a night at the hostel near the Brussels airport, and have strong memories of having a beer while Christmas music.

In 2023, I returned in a very different capacity, this time as Community Manager of The Turing Way project. Here, I gave a [talk]() about the project, my first in-person conference talk in quite a few months! 

It was my first time being at such a big conference since before the pandemic, and I remember the shock I'd had at being in stadium-like spaces for the Keynotes, and in lecture halls for the devrooms. Many more people attended in 2023 as well - after years of the conference being online.

At the time, there was a photo exhibit outside of the main stage, where I learned about how the [Université Libre de Bruxelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_Libre_de_Bruxelles) had previously hosted many rock musicians and artists in the second half of the 20th century: from Patti Smith to Tom Waits.

>_Description of the photo exhibit. The text reads: with the advent of independent local radio stations, young people discovered new music (imported directly and often illegally) that was produced by young bands that wanted to move on from the Beatles. Hammering riffs, explicit and committed lyrics.. Everything to seduce a generation of students who were tired of listening to the same old. same old and wanted more impulsive, alternative stations. A wave of more virulent rockers and aggressive sounds came crashing down at the new Caroline Music corner in the F1 Building. So why not welcome them. in the Janson._

>_The 1,500 seats and auditorium furniture did not prevent concertgoers from climbing onto the benches, nor did the poor acoustics bother the amateurs or the often-emerging musicians who were trying out their skills. The auditorium was easy to book, and it was easy to persuade the bands that a good European tour started at ULB.__

>_From 1970 to 1981, militant concerts alternated with newcomers in the fields of after-pop, glitter, punk, hard rock, electro, reggae, new and cold waves, punctuated with singer-songwriters, jazz and experimental music. Manfred Mann, Tom Waits, Patti Smith, Ramones, Blondie, Kraftwerk, Soft Machine OMD, Magma, Runaways Kevin Avers, Machiavel Steel Pulse. not to mention Bashung, Ferré, Renaud, Capdevielle, Maurane. Stella, Philip Catherine, etc. all raised the roof of the janson. the city's new musical temple. The auditorium closed its doors in 1981 to the sound of disco, transporting students to more glittering settings.

I'd "been" to FOSDEM previously, just not in this room at the University of Bruxelles. I first attended the online conference in 2022, through the recommendation of Lily Winfree, then the coordinator of the Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellowship that I was a part of. 

I had heard a lot about Brussels in the literature around human rights.
