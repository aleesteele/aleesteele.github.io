I recently compiled a list of essays that have influenced how I see the world, in no particular order. 

Some influenced me because they described traits I already had, and identified trends I was already identifying with (for better and for worse)

Some influenced my values - and pushed me to better define how I _wanted_ to move through the world.

Some provoked me into thinking about myself in more crtical and self-aware ways.

Anyway - thought they would be good to place here!
