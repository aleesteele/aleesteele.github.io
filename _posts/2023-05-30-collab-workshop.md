_05.02.23: I found these notes while looking at previous conferences. This seems like something that could be uploaded publicly!_

Flagging some materials I had shared within my team this week. After attending Collaborations Workshop, there were a couple of emerging themes. 

Just my view, but most of the information you see around these topics focus on either the labor behind open source and or different types of business models. For example: 
- The most famous "open source" dichotomy is the cathedral vs bazaar model, which essentially pits a closed development process w/ open release against a open development w/ open release process: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar
- 'Roads & Bridges' by Nadia Eghbal has a great section called "sustaining digital Infrastructure" which lists a bunch of business models as well: Bounties, Services, Paid Licenses, Sponsors/Donors, Corporate Sponsorship (essentially overlapping or expanding what BGT already shared!).  [not attached here!]
- This medium article also highlights different types in a more business-friendly format & with charts: https://insights.blossomcap.com/successful-open-source-business-models-2709e831e38a

However, the above may not be as relevant or perhaps too general for what we're talking about right now: because support doesn't just look like funding Â£$, but also institutional structures that enable it.

Along these lines, I've increasingly seen three institutionalised models gaining a lot of steam & publicity recently, as well as securing funding at massive scale: Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs), Inner Source, and Digital Public Goods.

- **Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs)**: Open source programme offices are getting a lot of traction in US & Europe right now, with a couple of offices being incubated in EU universties, and some major open source players like Linux/Eclipse getting involved
- --> "The Cathedral, the Bazaar & the Coffeehouse": Saw this talk at FOSS Backstage that argued for them, building off of the cathedral vs bazaar idea: https://program.foss-backstage.de/fossback23/talk/8YHTY9/
- **Inner Source**: Inner source also seems to be gaining traction as a means of disentangling open ways of working WITHIN a group or institution from open source as a public process (i.e. enabling the cathedral method when necessary when the bazaar method seems to be the moral good right now!)
- --> "Inner Source 101": An intro talk, also from FOSS Backstage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlMeNA8p7vU&list=PLq-odUc2x7i9kfJWH6yBsHuJasukhluUi&index=1
- **Digital Public Goods / Public code**: The digital public goods & digital public infrastructure narrative has been around for a while now, but a few actors seem to be emerging as the leads in this space, like the Foundation for Public Good & the Digital Public Goods Alliance. Also getting a lot of traction of the EU/USA level.
- ---> "How the Standard for Public Code can help you collaborate over time & space": Yet another FOSS Backstage intro! I did hear about these before this conference! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKl3BX9kAbY
- Also attached a report from the Standard for Public Code that aims to make this process (the fact that it splits between policy makers, management, and designers & developers is great!)
