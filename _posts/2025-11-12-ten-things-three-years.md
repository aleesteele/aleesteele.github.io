_Note: Back in August of 2022, I [wrote a blog]() that aimed to summarise some personal reflections about digital life, community management, and researcher/praxis reflections a year into my role with The Turing Way. As Jia Tolentino wrote in her book **Trick Mirror**: "I write to think", and for me, this is true as well. Journalistic or creative writing uses a very different set of muscles than documentation or academic writing, and as I finish off three years with the project, I wanted to document these broader reflections._

For now, I've just added the list as it's more important to get out there. But I would love to be able to expand upon each of these points.
### 1. Community-building is not the same as understanding  the practices of community management.

### 2. Scientific research is not the same as technological development – their cultures, norms, and practices are different

### 3. Teaching and facilitation is an art and a practice 

### 4. Balancing the requirements of maintenance and the generativity of creativity is hard.

### 5. Difference matters as much as it has the space it has to flourish.

### 6. Intergenerational histories and myths are really important in sustaining the culture of an open source project. 

### 7. Being in community with each other requires suspending some amount of disbelief – and critique. It requires simply being together.

### 8. Transparency and trust are interlinked, but are not the same thing.

### 9. Sustaining third spaces for others does not necessarily create a third space for yourself.

### 10. Community building is in the small things: rituals are important

### In summary?

It's funny how so many of these

## A few runner ups (that didn't make the list)
- What you share is as important as how you share
- Openness alone isn't enough (what about translation and accessibility?)
- So many movements have so much to learn from open science
- Integrating critique can render solution making difficult
- Balancing maintenance and generative creativity
- Who is heard (and who is not) is 
- You cannot be everywhere at once -- all information in partial
- why is art always cornered into a "let's think about ethics" corner?
- The behaviour of being open is a habit - and a practice
- Open "AI" has shifted the landscape and priorities of openness - not necessarily for the better
- You cannot manage a community from the margins (as a community manager) – but you can seek to bring other perspectives in support it.
- Being "in the arena" looks very different depending on your discipline (and requires very different muscles!)
- Education is liberatory – but that liberation looks very different for different people.
- Open science for many is a deeply personal experience.  
- Transparency and trust are interlinked, but are not the same thing
- Going beyond traditional research outputs looks very different depending on the space you are in
- The Turing Way is a pulse on the wider research field
